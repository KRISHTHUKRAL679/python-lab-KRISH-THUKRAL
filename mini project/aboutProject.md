Project Synopsis: Blood Report Analysis System
Project Title: Blood Report Analyzer

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based application that analyzes a user's blood report and determines which values are within the healthy range and which are not. The system will allow users to input their blood test results, then compare those results with standard healthy ranges for various blood parameters to provide a comprehensive health analysis.

Features:

User Input:
The application will accept input from users in the form of their blood test results (such as hemoglobin levels, cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, etc.) either through text input or by uploading an image of their report.

Health Range Database:
The application will have a pre-defined database that contains the healthy range values for common blood parameters, such as:

Hemoglobin levels
Red and white blood cell counts
Cholesterol (LDL, HDL)
Blood sugar levels
Liver enzymes
Thyroid function
Kidney function
Electrolyte levels, etc.
Comparison and Analysis:
The system will compare the values entered by the user with the healthy range values from the database. For each blood parameter:

If the value is within the healthy range, it will be marked as "Healthy."
If the value is outside the healthy range, it will be flagged as "Abnormal," and a brief suggestion or recommendation (such as consulting a doctor or further testing) will be provided.
Result Report:
After the analysis, the system will generate a summary report outlining which values are healthy and which are abnormal. This will allow users to understand the status of their health based on their blood report.

Allow users to input data manually
Provide suggestions for abnormal values.

Expected Outcomes:

Accuracy: The project aims to provide accurate health assessments based on users' blood reports by comparing their values against recognized medical standards.
Health Awareness: Users will gain a better understanding of their blood test results and be informed about any health risks indicated by abnormal values.
Personalized Recommendations: The application will offer basic recommendations for users based on their test results, encouraging them to take action when necessary (e.g., seeking medical advice, making lifestyle changes).
